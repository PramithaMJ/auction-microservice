# Auction Website Architecture Report

## 1. Core Architectural Patterns

### 1.1 Microservices Architecture

The auction system implements a true microservices architecture where each service:

- Has a single business responsibility
- Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- Owns its data domain
- Communicates through well-defined interfaces

### 1.2 Database-per-Service Pattern

#### Implementation Details

Each microservice exclusively owns its database, with no direct database sharing:


| Service    | Database Type | Data Domain                             |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Auth       | MongoDB       | User credentials, roles, permissions    |
| Profile    | PostgreSQL    | User profiles, preferences, reputation  |
| Listings   | PostgreSQL    | Auction items, descriptions, categories |
| Bid        | MongoDB       | Bid records, bid history                |
| Payments   | PostgreSQL    | Payment transactions, payment methods   |
| Expiration | Redis         | Time-sensitive operations               |
| Email      | MongoDB       | Email templates, delivery status        |

#### Logical Separation

Database separation is enforced through:

1. **Infrastructure isolation**: Separate database instances
2. **Access control**: Service-specific database credentials
3. **Network segmentation**: Database access limited to owning service

#### Benefits in the Auction Context

- **Specialized data storage**: Each service uses the most appropriate database technology
- **Independent scaling**: The bid service database can scale during peak auction times without affecting other services
- **Failure isolation**: Database issues in the payment service don't impact auction listings
- **Schema evolution**: The profile service can modify its schema without coordinating with other teams

## 2. CQRS Implementation

### 2.1 Command-Query Responsibility Segregation

The auction platform implements CQRS by separating read and write operations:

#### Write Side (Commands)

- **Command Models**: Optimized for data consistency and validation
- **Command Handlers**: Process business logic and data mutations
- **Command Databases**: Normalized schemas for data integrity

#### Read Side (Queries)

- **Query Models**: Optimized for specific view requirements
- **Query Handlers**: Retrieve and shape data for client consumption
- **Read Databases**: Denormalized schemas for query performance

### 2.2 CQRS Implementation by Service

#### Listings Service CQRS

- **Command Side**:

  - Handles auction creation, updates, and state changes
  - Uses normalized data model with integrity constraints
  - Focuses on transaction consistency
- **Query Side**:

  - Serves various specialized read models:
    - AuctionSummaryView (for browse pages)
    - AuctionDetailView (for item detail pages)
    - SellerDashboardView (for seller management)
  - Uses denormalized data for fast retrieval
  - Updates via event handlers

#### Bid Service CQRS

- **Command Side**:

  - Processes bid placement with validation rules
  - Maintains bid sequence integrity
  - Enforces bidding business rules
- **Query Side**:

  - Provides specialized read models:
    - CurrentBidStatus (shows highest bid)
    - BidHistoryView (shows chronological bid history)
    - UserBidSummary (for user dashboard)

### 2.3 Read Model Synchronization

Read models are kept synchronized through event-driven updates:

1. Command handlers publish domain events after successful operations
2. Read model updaters subscribe to these events
3. Updaters transform event data into appropriate read model format
4. Read databases are updated asynchronously

## 3. Event-Driven Architecture Details

### 3.1 Event Flow Architecture

The system employs a sophisticated event flow to maintain consistency across service boundaries:

```
┌────────────┐       ┌────────────┐       ┌────────────┐
│            │       │            │       │            │
│  Command   │──────►│   Domain   │──────►│    Read    │
│  Handler   │       │   Events   │       │   Model    │
│            │       │            │       │  Updater   │
└────────────┘       └────────────┘       └────────────┘
                            │
                            │
                            ▼
                     ┌────────────┐
                     │            │
                     │ Integration│
                     │   Events   │
                     │            │
                     └──────┬─────┘
                            │
              ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
              │             │             │
              ▼             ▼             ▼
        ┌────────────┐┌────────────┐┌────────────┐
        │            ││            ││            │
        │  Service A ││  Service B ││  Service C │
        │  Handler   ││  Handler   ││  Handler   │
        │            ││            ││            │
        └────────────┘└────────────┘└────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Event Taxonomy

The auction system utilizes three categories of events:

1. **Domain Events** (Internal to services)

   - `AuctionCreated`
   - `BidPlaced`
   - `ReservePriceUpdated`
2. **Integration Events** (Cross-service communication)

   - `AuctionPublished`
   - `BidAccepted`
   - `AuctionEnded`
3. **Notification Events** (User-facing updates)

   - `BidOutpaced`
   - `AuctionWon`
   - `PaymentRequired`

### 3.3 Event Schema Evolution

The system handles event schema changes through:

- **Schema versioning**: Events include version metadata
- **Consumer-driven contracts**: Services define expected event schema
- **Compatibility layers**: Transform events between versions when needed

## 4. Data Consistency Strategies

### 4.1 Consistency Models

Different parts of the system employ appropriate consistency models:

- **Strong Consistency**: Used within single-service transactional boundaries

  - Bid placement validation
  - User authentication
  - Payment processing
- **Eventual Consistency**: Used across service boundaries

  - Auction listing updates in search indexes
  - User profile updates reflected in auction listings
  - Bid history in user dashboards

### 4.2 Dual-Write Problem Solutions

To avoid dual-write inconsistencies, the system implements:

- **Outbox Pattern**: Commands store events in local transaction before publishing
- **Event Sourcing**: Key services rebuild state from event streams
- **Idempotent Event Handlers**: Safely process duplicate events

## 5. End-to-End Workflows

### 5.1 Auction Creation Workflow

1. **Command Phase**:

   - Seller submits auction creation command to API Gateway
   - Gateway routes to Listings service
   - Command handler validates input
   - Auction record created in Listings database
   - `AuctionCreated` domain event published
2. **Read Model Updates**:

   - Read model updater receives `AuctionCreated` event
   - AuctionSummaryView and AuctionDetailView updated
   - Integration event `AuctionPublished` emitted
3. **Cross-Service Effects**:

   - Search service indexes new auction
   - Notification service alerts interested buyers
   - Analytics service updates seller dashboard metrics

### 5.2 Bid Placement Workflow

1. **Command Validation**:

   - Buyer submits bid through API Gateway
   - Bid service receives bid command
   - Validation against business rules:
     - Auction still active
     - Bid amount exceeds minimum increment
     - Buyer has sufficient funds/reputation
2. **Command Processing**:

   - Bid record created in Bid database
   - `BidPlaced` domain event published internally
   - Bid query models updated
   - `BidAccepted` integration event published
3. **Cross-Service Coordination**:

   - Saga orchestrator initiates bid placement saga
   - User service tentatively reserves funds
   - Listings service updates current high bid
   - Notification service alerts previous high bidder
   - If any step fails, compensating transactions executed

### 5.3 Auction Completion Workflow

1. **Expiration Trigger**:

   - Expiration service detects auction end time
   - Publishes `AuctionExpirationReached` event
2. **Winner Determination**:

   - Bid service determines winning bid
   - Listings service marks auction as completed
   - `AuctionCompleted` event published with winner details
3. **Post-Auction Processing**:

   - Payment service initiates payment collection saga
   - Notification service alerts winner and seller
   - User reputation service updates seller/buyer ratings
   - Analytics service updates market trend data

## 6. Technical Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Message Broker Architecture

The system uses a hybrid messaging architecture:

- **NATS Streaming**: For guaranteed delivery of critical events
- **NATS JetStream**: For event persistence and replay
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: For high-throughput, lower-criticality notifications

### 6.2 Read Model Storage Optimization

Read models are optimized using:

- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed query results stored in optimized format
- **Document Stores**: MongoDB for flexible schema read models
- **In-Memory Caches**: Redis for high-velocity data like current bid status
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for text search and faceting

### 6.3 CQRS Performance Considerations

The CQRS implementation addresses performance through:

- **Read Model Denormalization**: Data shaped for specific UI requirements
- **Eager Loading**: Related entities included in read models to avoid joins
- **Cache Warming**: Popular auction read models pre-loaded into cache
- **Read Replicas**: Database replicas dedicated to query operations

## 7. Service Communication Patterns

### 7.1 Inter-Service Communication

Services communicate through a mix of patterns:

- **Synchronous REST APIs**: For query operations requiring immediate response
- **Asynchronous Events**: For state changes and notifications
- **gRPC**: For high-performance internal service calls

### 7.2 API Gateway Responsibilities

The API Gateway provides:

- **Request Routing**: Directs requests to appropriate services
- **API Composition**: Aggregates data from multiple services
- **Protocol Translation**: Converts external HTTP to internal protocols
- **Authentication**: Validates user identity before forwarding requests

## 8. Database Design Considerations

### 8.1 Polyglot Persistence

The system leverages multiple database technologies:

- **PostgreSQL**: For structured relational data (listings, payments)
- **MongoDB**: For flexible document data (user profiles, bid history)
- **Redis**: For caching and time-sensitive operations
- **Elasticsearch**: For full-text search and advanced querying
- **Neo4j**: For relationship-heavy data (fraud detection, user connections)

### 8.2 Data Partitioning Strategies

Services implement appropriate partitioning:

- **Listings**: Partitioned by category and listing status
- **Bids**: Sharded by auction ID
- **Users**: Geographically partitioned
- **Payments**: Partitioned by time period

## 9. System Evolution and Adaptability

### 9.1 Service Boundary Evolution

The system architecture supports evolution through:

- **Anti-Corruption Layers**: Isolate changing services from stable ones
- **API Versioning**: Support multiple API versions during transitions
- **Feature Toggles**: Gradually enable new functionality
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Switch between service versions without downtime

### 9.2 Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive monitoring includes:

- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger tracks requests across services
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus gathers operational metrics
- **Log Aggregation**: ELK stack centralizes logs
- **Business Metrics**: Custom dashboards for auction performance
- **Saga Monitoring**: Specialized UI for distributed transaction tracking

## 10. Resilience Mechanisms

### 10.1 Resilience Patterns Beyond Circuit Breakers

The system implements advanced resilience patterns:

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents service overload from excessive requests
- **Backpressure**: Services signal when they're approaching capacity limits
- **Load Shedding**: Non-critical operations deferred during peak load
- **Request Prioritization**: Critical operations given processing priority
- **Cache Fallbacks**: Stale data served when fresh data unavailable

### 10.2 Data Resilience

Data integrity is protected through:

- **Event Sourcing**: Critical state can be rebuilt from event streams
- **Snapshot Strategies**: Periodic state snapshots reduce rebuild time
- **Audit Logging**: All state changes recorded for verification
- **Command Replay**: Failed operations can be replayed from command log

## 11. System Boundaries and Integration

### 11.1 External System Integration

The auction platform integrates with external systems through dedicated adapters:

- **Payment Gateways**: Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- **Shipping Services**: Shipping rate and tracking integration
- **Email Providers**: Transactional email delivery
- **Analytics Platforms**: Business intelligence integration
- **Fraud Detection Services**: Third-party verification

### 11.2 Integration Patterns

External integrations use established patterns:

- **API Adapters**: Convert between internal and external protocols
- **Anti-Corruption Layers**: Protect from external system changes
- **Gateway Services**: Dedicated services for external communication
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protect from external system failures

## 12. Conclusion

The auction website architecture represents a sophisticated implementation of modern distributed systems design. By applying patterns like CQRS, database-per-service, and event-driven architecture, the system achieves the seemingly contradictory goals of loose coupling between services while maintaining data consistency across the platform.

The careful separation of read and write concerns enables the system to scale differently for different usage patterns. Write operations, which require consistency, can be optimized for correctness, while read operations can be denormalized and cached for performance.

This architecture provides both technical benefits (scalability, resilience, maintainability) and business advantages (rapid feature development, targeted scaling, technology flexibility). The event-driven nature of the system creates a detailed audit trail of all activities, supporting both business analytics and technical troubleshooting.

Through the combination of these architectural patterns, the auction platform achieves high availability, performance, and consistency while maintaining the ability to evolve individual services independently.



# Auction Website Architecture & Design Documentation

## 1. System Overview

The auction website is built on a modern, cloud-native microservices architecture that employs several reliability and scalability patterns. The system is designed to handle complex auction workflows while maintaining consistency across distributed services.

## 2. Microservices Architecture

### 2.1 Service Breakdown

The system is composed of the following microservices:


| Service               | Responsibility                                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **api-gateway**       | Entry point for client requests, routing, API composition |
| **auth**              | User authentication and authorization                     |
| **bid**               | Bid placement and management                              |
| **email**             | Email notifications                                       |
| **expiration**        | Time-based operations (auction deadlines)                 |
| **frontend**          | User interface                                            |
| **listings**          | Auction listings management                               |
| **payments**          | Payment processing                                        |
| **profile**           | User profile management                                   |
| **saga-orchestrator** | Distributed transaction management                        |

### 2.2 Service Communication

Services communicate primarily through:

- **Synchronous REST APIs** for direct queries
- **Asynchronous events** for state propagation and process coordination

## 3. Saga Pattern Implementation

The system implements the saga pattern to maintain data consistency across microservices without distributed transactions.

### 3.1 Saga Orchestration Approach

The `saga-orchestrator` service acts as a central coordinator implementing the orchestration pattern rather than choreography:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
│  Orchestrator   │◄───── Initiates saga
│                 │
└───────┬─────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                               │
▼              ▼              ▼              ▼  │
┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐
│ S1  │───►│ S2  │───►│ S3  │───►│ S4  │───►│ S5  │
└─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘
  │          │          │          │          │
  ▼          ▼          ▼          ▼          ▼
┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐    ┌─────┐
│ C1  │◄───│ C2  │◄───│ C3  │◄───│ C4  │◄───│ C5  │
└─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘    └─────┘
                                               │
                                               │
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
│ Forward transactions (S1-S5)
│ Compensating transactions (C5-C1) if any step fails
▼
```

### 3.2 Implemented Sagas

The system implements four main saga types:

1. **User Registration Saga**

   - Account creation
   - Profile initialization
   - Welcome email
2. **Bid Placement Saga**

   - Funds reservation
   - Bid recording
   - Notification to seller
3. **Auction Completion Saga**

   - Winner determination
   - Notification to participants
   - Payment initiation
4. **Payment Processing Saga**

   - Payment authorization
   - Payment capture
   - Receipt generation
   - Order fulfillment updates

### 3.3 Saga State Management

The `EnhancedSagaStateManager` class manages saga state persistence using Redis:

```typescript
class EnhancedSagaStateManager {
  async getSagaState(sagaType: string, sagaId: string): Promise<SagaState | null>
  async updateSagaState(sagaState: SagaState): Promise<void>
  async getStalledSagas(): Promise<SagaState[]>
  async getAllActiveSagas(): Promise<SagaState[]>
}
```

### 3.4 Compensation Logic

Each saga implements compensating transactions to rollback changes in case of failures:

```typescript
private async startCompensation(saga: SagaState): Promise<void>
private async compensateAuthorization(saga: SagaState): Promise<void>
private async compensateCapture(saga: SagaState): Promise<void>
private async compensateInvoice(saga: SagaState): Promise<void>
```

## 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

### 4.1 Implementation

Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures by temporarily disabling calls to failing services:

```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED';
  private failureCount: number = 0;
  private successCount: number = 0;
  private lastFailureTime: number = 0;
  
  // Configuration
  private failureThreshold: number;
  private resetTimeout: number;
  private successThreshold: number;
  
  async execute<T>(command: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    // Implementation logic for different states
    // If OPEN - reject immediately
    // If CLOSED - execute and track results
    // If HALF_OPEN - allow limited tries
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Circuit Breaker Dashboard Integration

Circuit breaker states are reported to the saga dashboard for operational visibility.

## 5. Bulkhead Pattern

### 5.1 Implementation

The bulkhead pattern isolates failures by limiting concurrent requests:

```typescript
class Bulkhead {
  private executingRequests: number = 0;
  private queue: Array<{ resolve: Function, reject: Function }> = [];
  
  // Configuration
  private maxConcurrentCalls: number;
  private maxQueueSize: number;
  
  async execute<T>(command: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    // Implementation logic to limit concurrent calls
    // and manage queue of pending requests
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Service-Specific Configurations

Each service has customized bulkhead configurations based on resource needs and criticality.

## 6. Distributed Tracing with Jaeger

### 6.1 Trace Context Propagation

Tracing headers are propagated through service calls:

```typescript
// Example of trace context propagation
const tracer = initTracer('payment-service');
const span = tracer.startSpan('process-payment');

// Add metadata to span
span.setTag('userId', userId);
span.setTag('amount', amount);

// Create headers for downstream service calls
const headers = {};
tracer.inject(span, FORMAT_HTTP_HEADERS, headers);

// Make HTTP request with headers
const response = await axios.post(url, data, { headers });

// Finish span
span.finish();
```

### 6.2 Trace Visualization

Jaeger UI provides comprehensive visualization of transaction flows across services.

## 7. Event-Driven Architecture

### 7.1 Event Types

The system uses several event types:

1. **Domain Events**: Business-significant occurrences

   - `UserRegisteredEvent`
   - `BidPlacedEvent`
   - `AuctionCompletedEvent`
   - `PaymentProcessedEvent`
2. **Integration Events**: Cross-service communication

   - `PaymentAuthorizedEvent`
   - `ReceiptSentEvent`
3. **Command Events**: Trigger specific actions

   - `CancelBidCommand`
   - `RetryPaymentCommand`

### 7.2 Event Publishing and Consumption

Services use a message broker (likely NATS based on references in the code) for event distribution:

```typescript
// Publishing events
await eventBus.publish('payment.authorized', {
  paymentId,
  amount,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});

// Consuming events
eventBus.subscribe('payment.authorized', async (data) => {
  // Handle the event
});
```

## 8. Monitoring and Observability

### 8.1 Saga Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard provides visibility into saga executions:

![Saga Dashboard](https://example.com/saga-dashboard.png)

Features:

- Real-time saga execution monitoring
- Stalled saga detection and management
- Health status indicators
- Bulk retry capabilities for failed operations

### 8.2 Metrics Collection

The system collects various operational metrics:

```typescript
async getSagaMetrics(): Promise<SagaMetrics> {
  const activeSagas = await this.getAllActiveSagas();
  const dailyMetrics = await this.client.hGetAll('saga:metrics:daily');
  
  const sagasByType = activeSagas.reduce((acc, saga) => {
    acc[saga.sagaType] = (acc[saga.sagaType] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<string, number>);

  const sagasByState = activeSagas.reduce((acc, saga) => {
    acc[saga.state] = (acc[saga.state] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<string, number>);

  const stalledSagas = await this.getStalledSagas();
  
  // Calculate success rate
  // Additional metrics processing
}
```

## 9. Resilience Patterns

### 9.1 Retry Mechanism

Systematic retry logic for transient failures:

```typescript
async retrySaga(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
  const { sagaId } = req.params;
  const { type } = req.body;

  try {
    let orchestrator;
    switch (type) {
      case 'user-registration':
        orchestrator = this.userRegistrationOrchestrator;
        break;
      case 'bid-placement':
        orchestrator = this.bidPlacementOrchestrator;
        break;
      // Additional cases
    }

    await orchestrator.retrySaga(sagaId);
  
    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'Saga retry initiated',
      sagaId,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

### 9.2 Dead Letter Queues

Failed messages are routed to dead letter queues for analysis and potential reprocessing.

### 9.3 Timeout Handling

Services implement timeout detection and handling:

```typescript
private calculateTimeOverdue(timeoutAt: string): number {
  const timeoutTimestamp = new Date(timeoutAt).getTime();
  const currentTimestamp = Date.now();
  
  return Math.max(0, currentTimestamp - timeoutTimestamp);
}
```

## 10. Data Consistency Patterns

### 10.1 Eventual Consistency

The system embraces eventual consistency where appropriate, using events to propagate state changes.

### 10.2 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Some services implement CQRS to separate read and write operations for better scalability.

## 11. Security Architecture

### 11.1 Authentication and Authorization

The auth service provides JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

### 11.2 API Gateway Security

The API gateway implements:

- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- CORS protection
- Authorization header validation

## 12. Deployment Architecture

### 12.1 Containerization

Services are containerized using Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/build ./build
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY package*.json ./
COPY start-service.sh ./

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["./start-service.sh"]
```

### 12.2 Orchestration

Kubernetes orchestrates containers with features like:

- Auto-scaling
- Self-healing
- Rolling updates
- Service discovery

## 13. Performance Considerations

### 13.1 Caching Strategy

Multi-level caching strategy:

- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Redis for distributed caching
- Client-side caching where appropriate

### 13.2 Asynchronous Processing

Non-critical operations are processed asynchronously to improve user experience.

## 14. System Workflow Examples

### 14.1 User Registration Saga Flow

```
1. Client requests user registration
2. API Gateway routes to Auth service
3. Auth service creates user credentials
4. Saga Orchestrator initiates registration saga
5. Profile service creates user profile
6. Email service sends welcome email
7. Saga completes successfully
```

### 14.2 Payment Processing Saga with Compensation

```
1. Payment authorization requested
2. Payment service authorizes payment
3. Payment capture fails
4. Saga Orchestrator initiates compensation
5. Payment authorization is reversed
6. User is notified of payment failure
7. Saga completes with compensation
```

## 15. Conclusion

The auction website architecture employs industry best practices for building resilient, scalable, and maintainable microservices. The saga pattern, combined with circuit breakers, bulkheads, and comprehensive monitoring, provides a robust foundation for managing complex distributed transactions while maintaining system reliability.

The event-driven design facilitates loose coupling between services, allowing for independent scaling and evolution of components while maintaining overall system integrity.
