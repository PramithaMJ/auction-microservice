# üåê IP Address Configuration Update Guide

## ‚úÖ Updated Configuration

Your Kubernetes configuration has been updated with your server IP: **34.229.99.72**

### Files Updated:
1. **`k8s/configmaps/auction-configmap.yaml`**
   - CORS_ORIGIN
   - Frontend configuration URLs
   - API Gateway URLs
   - Socket URLs

2. **`k8s/ingress/auction-ingress.yaml`**
   - CORS allow origins

## üñ•Ô∏è Host File Changes (Optional)

### For Local Development/Testing:

If you want to use a domain name instead of the IP address, you can add entries to your hosts file:

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add these lines:
```
34.229.99.72    auction-app.local
34.229.99.72    api.auction-app.local
```

#### On Windows:
```
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

Add the same lines as above.

### Benefits of Host File Changes:
- Use friendly domain names instead of IP addresses
- Better for development and testing
- Easier to remember URLs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
Host file changes are **NOT required** for the Kubernetes deployment to work. Your application will work perfectly with the IP address.

## üöÄ Access URLs

After deployment, you can access your application at:

### With IP Address (Default):
- **Main Application**: http://34.229.99.72
- **Frontend**: http://34.229.99.72:3000
- **API Gateway**: http://34.229.99.72:3001
- **API Docs**: http://34.229.99.72:3001/api-docs

### With Host File Entries (Optional):
- **Main Application**: http://auction-app.local
- **API Gateway**: http://api.auction-app.local:3001

## üîß Network Configuration Details

### Public IP: 34.229.99.72
- This is your server's external IP address
- Used for external access to your application
- Configured in ingress and service configurations

### Private IP: 172.31.46.3
- This is your server's internal AWS VPC IP
- Used for internal AWS communication
- **No changes needed** in Kubernetes configs for this IP

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **No host file changes required** - your app will work with IP addresses
2. **Deploy your application**:
   ```bash
   cd k8s
   ./deploy-all.sh
   ```
3. **Access your application** at http://34.229.99.72

## üîç Verification Commands

After deployment, verify your configuration:

```bash
# Check if services are accessible
curl http://34.229.99.72:3001/health
curl http://34.229.99.72:3000

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n auction-system

# Check services
kubectl get svc -n auction-system
```

## üåê Production Domain Setup (Future)

For production, you should:
1. **Get a proper domain name** (e.g., yourdomain.com)
2. **Point your domain's A record** to 34.229.99.72
3. **Update the Kubernetes configs** with your domain
4. **Set up SSL/TLS certificates** using cert-manager or AWS Certificate Manager

Example production configuration:
```yaml
# In configmaps/auction-configmap.yaml
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: "https://api.yourdomain.com"
CORS_ORIGIN: "https://yourdomain.com,https://api.yourdomain.com"
```

---

**Summary**: Your configuration is ready! No host file changes are required. Your application will be accessible at http://34.229.99.72 after deployment.
